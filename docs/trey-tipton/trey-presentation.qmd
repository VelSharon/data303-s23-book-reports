## What is "Big Data"?

"big data refers to things one can do at a large scale that cannot be done at a smaller one, to extract new insights or create new forms of value, in ways that change markets, organizations, the relationship between citizens and governments, and more." (13)

## What Made Big Data Possible?

These mindset shifts in the data world:

-   there is a lot more data, and it speaks!
-   data is messy, and that's okay
-   respect correlation, not causality

## Big Data Transforms the Way We...

and it changes the way companies/countries...

-   market, grow
-   hire/fire
-   police our areas
-   govern/make laws

## At What Cost?

-   Data is fallible
-   Privacy and freedom
-   Dictatorship of Data
-   Takes away some of the work, devalues experience

# Themes

## Theme 1: Why vs. What?

-   Causality vs. Correlation
-   Asking why can lead to wrong decisions
-   Correlation is more reliable and easier to prove mathematically
-   Causality has been knocked off its pedestal
-   Asking what leads to information, which is what truly transforms us
-   Causality comes after big data does its work, correlation is the priority

## Theme 2: Tradeoffs

::: incremental
In the era of big data, we have to trade:

-   intuition for data
-   cleanliness of data for larger datasets
-   freedom and privacy for safety
-   anonymity and personalization
-   free will for accurate predictions
-   exactitude for value
-   generalization/prejudice for individual profiling/less discrimination
